## Lipid trial

.large[

- Time to event outcome (.red[Y]):
      - coronary heart disease (CHD) death, or
      - or non-fatal myocardial infarction

- Exposure (.red[A]): 
      - cholestyramine or
      - placebo

- Population: 
      - people with very high levels of LDL cholesterol,
      - 35-59 years aged, 
      - initially free of CHD,
      - recruited between mid-1973 and mid-1976.
      

]

---


## Lipid trial 

.large[

- 2-armed double-blind RCT
      - $3,550$ subjects eligible
      - randomized at 5th visit and 
      - followed $\ge 7$ years

- .red[Static sustained treatment regime]

- Medication adherence 
      - counts of unused medication packets

]

---

## Lipid trial 


.large[
*Baseline prognostic factors* (.red[**B**])

1. baseline risk strata (ECG, LDL, smoking etc.), 
2. age at randomization, 
3. physical activity level at work at baseline, 
4. educational status, and 
5. race.

*Post-randomization prognostic factors* (.red[**L**])

- 38 time-varying covariates
]

## Adherence adjustment methods
.pull-left[
.large[**Intention to Treat (.red[ITT])**]

- compares randomized to treatment arm vs. control arm
- no adherence adjustment
]


.pull-right[
.large[**Naive Per-protocol (.red[Naive PP])**]

- .red[artificially censoring] when become non-adherent 
- no covariate adjustment
- alternate version .red[excludes patients]
]

.pull-left[
.large[**Conditional Per-protocol (.red[Adj. PP])**]

.large[
- .red[B] adjusted PP
- .red[L] adjusted PP
- .red[B + L] adjusted PP
]
]

.pull-right[
.large[**IP of (Adherence) Weighted Per-protocol (.red[sIPW PP])**]

- .red[model-based] vs .red[cumulative survival-based]
- B and L adjusted in stab. IPWs (address .red[artificially censoring])
- B adjusted in weighted outcome model
- .red[uIPW] is another version with unstabilized weights
]

.large[
**Treatment effect estimates**
]

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tableOR.png')
```

.large[
- true DAG unknown 
- unknown whether all adherence predicting factors were measured
- finite sample size: $3,550$
- high non-adherence rate 
- differential non-adherence: $84\%$ vs. $77.2\%$
- low event rate: $7.3\%$ (pooled logistic model)
- measurement schedule varied 
- LOCF was used for imputation 

]

## Literature search about IPW 

.large[
- .red[**Robins and Finkelstein**] (2000): 
    - asymptotic consistent if model correctly specified
    
- .red[Hernan and Robins] (2017), .red[Murray and Hernan] (2016, 2018):
    - Reanalysis; addressing treatment-confounder feedback

- .red[Morden et al.] (2011), .red[Latimer et al.] (2017, 2018)  
    - estimates sensitive to switching proportions
    
- .red[**Young et al.**] (2019): 
    - interval censoring simulation framework
    - 200K, 1 DAG, null treatment effect, 
    - differing measurement schedule, varying confounding
  
]

## New Simulations

**B affects A and Y directly**: .red[Adjusting B blocks backdoor]

*Diag 1(i)*: A affects subsequent L


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG.png')
```

*Diag 1(ii)*: A does not affect subsequent L

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
