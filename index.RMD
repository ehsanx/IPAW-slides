- Lipid trial

## Lipid trial

.large[

- Time to event outcome:
      - coronary heart disease (CHD) death or
      - non-fatal myocardial infarction

- Exposure: 
      - cholestyramine or
      - placebo

- Population: 
      - people with very high levels of LDL cholesterol,
      - 35-59 years aged, 
      - initially free of CHD,
      - recruited between mid-1973 and mid-1976.
      

]

## Lipid trial 

.large[

- 2-armed double-blind RCT
      - $3,550$ subjects eligible
      - randomized at 5th visit and 
      - followed $\ge 7$ years

- Static treatment regime

- Medication adherence 
      - counts of unused medication packets
      - satisfactory adherence as $\ge 80\%$
      - $84.0\%$ in the treatment arm were nonadherent
      - $77.2\%$ in the placebo arm.

]

## Lipid trial 


.large[
*Baseline prognostic factors* (.red[**B**])

- baseline risk strata (ECG, LDL, smoking etc.), 
- age at randomization, 
- physical activity level at work at baseline, 
- educational status, and 
- race.

*Post-randomization prognostic factors* (.red[**L**])

- 38 time-varying covariates
]

## Adherence adjustment
.pull-left[
.large[**Intention to Treat (ITT)**]

- compares randomized to treatment arm vs. control arm
- no adherence adjustment
]


.pull-right[
.large[**Naive Per-protocol (Naive PP)**]

- artificially censoring when become non-adherent 
- no covariate adjustment
- alternate version exlcudes patients
]

.pull-left[
.large[**Conditional Per-protocol (Adj. PP)**]

- B adjusted PP
- L adjusted PP
- B+L adjusted PP
]

.pull-right[
.large[**IP of (Adherence) Weighted Per-protocol (sIPW PP)**]

- IP Weights adjust for bias introduced by artificially censoring
- L adjusted in IP weights
- B adjusted in weighted outcome model
- uIPW is another version with unstabilized weights

## Treatment effect estimates



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tableOR.png')
```

.large[
- low event rate: $7.3\%$. 
- differential adherence rate
- measurement schedule varied
- true DAG unknown
- unknown whether all adherence predicting factors were measured
]

## Literature search about IPW vs. conditionals

.large[
- Robins and Finkelstein (2000): 
    - asymptotic consistent if model correctly specified
    
- Hernan and Robins (2017), Murray and Hernan (2016, 2018):
    - Reanalysis; addressing treatment-confounder feedback
    
- Young et al. (2019): 
    - interval censoring simulation: 200K, null treatment effect, differing measurement schedule
    
- Morden et al. (2011), Latimer et al. (2017, 2018)  
    - estimates sensitive to switching proportions

## New Simulations

**B affects A and Y directly**: 

*Diag 1(i)*: A affects subsequent L


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG.png')
```

*Diag 1(ii)*: A does not affect subsequent L

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG8.png')
```

## New Simulations

**B affects Y directly, but affects A indirectly via L**: 

*Diag 2(i)*: A affects subsequent L


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG2.png')
```

*Diag 2(ii)*: A does not affect subsequent L

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG5.png')
```

## New Simulations

**B affects A and Y directly, but not A**: 

*Diag 3(i)*: A affects subsequent L


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG3.png')
```

*Diag 3(ii)*: A does not affect subsequent L

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG4.png')
```

## New Simulations

**B does not affect A or Y**: 

*Diag 4(i)*: A affects subsequent L


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG7.png')
```

*Diag 4(ii)*: A does not affect subsequent L

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mainDAG6.png')
