## Lipid trial

.large[

- Outcome: 
      - coronary heart disease (CHD) death or
      - non-fatal myocardial infarction

- Exposure: 
      - cholestyramine or a placebo

- Population: 
      - people with very high levels of LDL cholesterol,
      - 35-59 years aged, 
      - initially free of CHD,
      - recruited between mid-1973 and mid-1976.

## Lipid trial 

.large[

- 2-armed double-blind RCT
      - $3,550$ subjects eligible
      - randomized at 5th visit and 
      - followed $\ge 7$ years

- Static treatment regime

- Medication adherence 
      - counts of unused medication packets
      - satisfactory adherence as $\ge 80\%$
      - $84.0\%$ in the treatment arm were nonadherent
      - $77.2\%$ in the placebo arm.

## Lipid trial 


.large[
*Baseline prognostic factors*

- baseline risk strata, 
- age at randomization, 
- physical activity level at work at baseline, 
- educational status, and 
- race.

*Post-randomization prognostic factors*

- 38 time-varying covariates
]

## Adherence adjustment

**Intention to Treat (ITT)**

- compares randomized to treatment arm vs. control arm

**Naive Per-protocol (Naive PP)**

- artificially censoring when become non-adherent to randomized treatment
- no covariate adjustment

**Conditional Per-protocol (Adj. PP)**

- B adjusted PP
- L adjusted PP
- B+L adjusted PP

**Inverse Probability of (Adherence) Weighted Per-protocol (sIPW PP)**

- IP Weights adjust for bias introduced by artificially censoring
- L adjusted in IP weights
- B adjusted in weighted outcome model
